           <p>Mac and Cheese is one of the BEST comfort foods out there in my honest opinion. I’m not talking about the packaged stuff, but rather the homemade goodness. It truly is special.

            One of my favorite things about mac and cheese is that you rarely find someone who doesn’t like it- kids included. My picky eaters gobble this stuff up by the bowl full.

            My favorite part of homemade mac and cheese happens to be the crispy edges and top. It adds just the right amount of crunch. Then it dawned on me… why not turn them into mini bite size pieces to make each bite that piece of heaven!</p>
