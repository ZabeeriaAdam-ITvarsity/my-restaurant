             <p>Spring rolls originate in China, where they were a dish designed to use fresh, spring vegetable produce.

Spring rolls found their way to the Philippines in the 7th Century, presumably via the extensive trading routes in the region. In the Philippines, spring rolls exists in a cooked format, but also in an un-fried variety known as ‘lumpia,‘ which is where the Dutch, Indonesian-derived spelling ‘loempia’ comes from.

Filipino spring rolls are large-format spring rolls filled with precooked ingredients and deep fried. They are typically present at celebration meals. The ‘gulay‘ variant contains both pork and shrimp along with selected vegetables, despite the word ‘gulay‘ meaning ‘vegetables,’ and being most often associated with fully vegetarian dishes … which Filipino gulay isn’t.</p>
